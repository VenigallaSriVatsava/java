OPERATORS we have 6 important operators that can used in java, those are                                            
1.Arithmetic operators                                                                                                
2.Assignment operators                                                                                                
3.Logical operators                                                                                                    
4.Bitwise operators                                                                                                    
5.Relational Operators                                                                                                
6.Unary operator

--> Arithmetic operators means simple operations like add,subtract,multiply,modulus and divide the symbols we use for
these operators are                                                                                              
Add - '+'                                                                                                         
Subtract - '-'                                                                                                         
Multiply - '*'                                                                                                       
Divide - '/'                                                                                                         
Modulus - '%' --> gives remainder of dividend and divisor

--> Assignment operators means it assigns values to the variables Eg:int a = 8; --> assigns value 8 to the variable 'a'
int b += 7; --> this is just as b = b + 7; int c *= 6; --> same as c = c*6; we can write similarly using other
arithmetic operators too

--> Bitwise operators will be used for binary operations of decimal inputs It will first convert decimal input into
binary equivalent and does the operation and will again convert back into decimal form

1. OR - '|' --> or operation gives resultant '1' if any of the input is 1,and '0' if both inputs are 0
2. AND - '&' --> and operation gives resultant '1' if both inputs are 1 and '0' if any of the input is 0
3. XOR - '^' --> xor operation gives resultant '1' if both inputs are different and '0' if both inputs are same

--> Logical operators will be used for logical operations between one or more conditions they are

1. OR - '||' --> logical or operation gives resultant 'True' if any of the condition is True,and 'False' if both
   conditions are False
2. AND - '&&' --> logical and operation gives resultant 'True' if both conditions are True and 'False' if any of the
   condition is False
3. NOT - '~'  --> logical not operations gives the output opposite of input,for true input it gives output as false and
   vice-versa

--> Relational operators will check relational between two inputs or variables

1. Equals - '=' represents two variables are equal
2. GreaterThan - '>' represents 1st variable is greater than 2nd one
3. lessThan - '<' represents 1st variable is less than 2nd one
4. GreaterThan or equal to - '>=' represents 1st variable is greater than or equal to 2nd one
5. LessThan or equal to - '<=' represents 1st variable is less than or equal to 2nd one

--> Unary operator consists of increment and decrement operator increment operator is of two types

1. pre increment operator - '++a' increases the value by 1 and assigns in the same step
2. post increment operator increases the value by 1 and assigns it in the next step similarly Decrement operator
   decreases the value
